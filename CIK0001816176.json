Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-08-02","end":"2020-08-07","val":0.2,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"start":"2020-09-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0.177,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-06-12","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.21,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25"},{"start":"2020-06-12","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.21,"accn":"0001213900-21-029130","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.144,"accn":"0001213900-21-029130","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-08-02","end":"2020-08-07","val":0.0032,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"start":"2020-09-01","end":"2020-09-30","val":0.0041,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"start":"2020-06-12","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0053,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25"},{"start":"2020-06-12","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0053,"accn":"0001213900-21-029130","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0114,"accn":"0001213900-21-029130","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-08-07","val":9.6,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q2I"},{"end":"2020-09-30","val":9.84,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.19,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-08-07","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-20-037150","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-16"},{"end":"2020-08-07","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-019109","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q2I"}],"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-08-07","val":10,"accn":"0001213900-21-029125","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q2I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
