Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.7734,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0043,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsGrantsInPeriodGross":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Grants in Period, Gross","description":"Gross number of share options (or share units) granted during the period.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":468800,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingIntrinsicValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Intrinsic Value","description":"Amount by which the current fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of options outstanding.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":177962000,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":106585000,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingNumber":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Number","description":"Number of options outstanding, including both vested and non-vested options.","units":{"shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":4776908,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":5238718,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsOutstandingWeightedAverageExercisePrice":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Outstanding, Weighted Average Exercise Price","description":"Weighted average price at which grantees can acquire the shares reserved for issuance under the stock option plan.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.83,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2020Q4I"},{"end":"2021-03-31","val":13.96,"accn":"0001558370-21-006823","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-11","frame":"CY2021Q1I"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardOptionsVestedAndExpectedToVestExercisableAggregateIntrinsicValue":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Options, Vested and Expected to Vest, Exercisable, Aggregate Intrinsic Value","description":"Amount by which current fair value of underlying stock exceeds exercise price of fully vested and expected to vest exercisable or convertible options.
