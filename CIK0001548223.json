Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2010-09-25","end":"2010-12-24","val":0.33,"accn":"0001193125-12-425650","fy":2012,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2012-10-17","frame":"CY2010Q4"},{"start":"2011-10-01","end":"2011-12-30","val":0.36,"accn":"0001193125-12-425650","fy":2012,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2012-10-17","frame":"CY2011Q4"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2010-09-25","end":"2010-12-24","val":0.0122,"accn":"0001193125-12-425650","fy":2012,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2012-10-17","frame":"CY2010Q4"},{"start":"2011-10-01","end":"2011-12-30","val":0.0146,"accn":"0001193125-12-425650","fy":2012,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2012-10-17","frame":"CY2011Q4"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardSharesIssuedInPeriod":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Shares Issued in Period","description":"Number of shares issued under share-based payment arrangement.","units":{"shares":[{"start":"2010-09-25","end":"2010-12-24","val":700000,"accn":"0001193125-12-425650","fy":2012,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2012-10-17","frame":"CY2010Q4"},{"start":"2011-10-01","end":"2011-12-30","val":600000,"accn":"0001193125-12-425650","fy":2012,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q/A","filed":"2012-10-17","frame":"CY2011Q4"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
