Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.397,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.397,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2019"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0,"accn":"0001564590-21-028105","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.005,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.005,"accn":"0001564590-21-028105","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMaximum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Maximum","description":"The maximum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.03,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.026,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2019"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMinimum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Minimum","description":"The minimum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2018-01-01","end":"2018-12-31","val":0.027,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2018"},{"start":"2019-01-01","end":"2019-12-31","val":0.017,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2019"}]}},"SignificantChangeInUnrecognizedTaxBenefitsIsReasonablyPossibleAmountOfUnrecordedBenefit":{"label":"Significant Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits is Reasonably Possible, Amount of Unrecorded Benefit","description":"The amount of the unrecognized tax benefit of a position taken for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount thereof will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the balance sheet date.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-12-31","val":0,"accn":"0001564590-21-014879","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-23","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
