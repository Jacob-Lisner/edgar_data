Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.3709,"accn":"0001193125-21-172315","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.5441,"accn":"0001193125-21-172315","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMaximum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Maximum","description":"The maximum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.0153,"accn":"0001193125-21-172315","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0009,"accn":"0001193125-21-172315","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRateMinimum":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate, Minimum","description":"The minimum risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.0018,"accn":"0001193125-21-172315","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0007,"accn":"0001193125-21-172315","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-25","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardNumberOfSharesAvailableForGrant":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Number of Shares Available for Grant","description":"The difference between the maximum number of shares (or other type of equity) authorized for issuance under the plan (including the effects of amendments and adjustments), and the sum of: 1) the number of shares (or other type of equity) already issued upon exercise of options or other equity-based awards under the plan;
