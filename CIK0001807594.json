The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.126,"accn":"0001213900-21-030522","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-02","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2021-01-01","end":"2021-03-31","val":0.0098,"accn":"0001213900-21-030522","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-06-02","frame":"CY2021Q1"}]}},"SharesIssuedPricePerShare":{"label":"Shares Issued, Price Per Share","description":"Per share or per unit amount of equity securities issued.","units":{"USD":[{"end":"2020-09-30","val":18,"accn":"0001213900-20-037128","fy":2020,"fp":"Q3","form":"10-Q","filed":"2020-11-16","frame":"CY2020Q3I"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":18,"accn":"0001213900-21-019203","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K","filed":"2021-03-31","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
