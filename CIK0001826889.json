Volatility also may be defined as a probability-weighted measure of the dispersion of returns about the mean. The volatility of a share price is the standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a specified period. That is the same as the standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the stock prices plus dividends, if any, over the period.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.433,"accn":"0001213900-21-026760","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-09-24","end":"2020-11-30","val":0.289,"accn":"0001213900-21-024207","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-03"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.313,"accn":"0001213900-21-026760","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2020-09-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.313,"accn":"0001213900-21-024207","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-03","frame":"CY2020Q4"}]}},"ShareBasedCompensationArrangementByShareBasedPaymentAwardFairValueAssumptionsRiskFreeInterestRate":{"label":"Share-based Compensation Arrangement by Share-based Payment Award, Fair Value Assumptions, Risk Free Interest Rate","description":"The risk-free interest rate assumption that is used in valuing an option on its own shares.","units":{"pure":[{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-03-31","val":0.0092,"accn":"0001213900-21-026760","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020Q1"},{"start":"2020-09-24","end":"2020-11-30","val":0.0045,"accn":"0001213900-21-024207","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-03"},{"start":"2020-01-01","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0044,"accn":"0001213900-21-026760","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020"},{"start":"2020-09-24","end":"2020-12-31","val":0.0044,"accn":"0001213900-21-024207","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-03","frame":"CY2020Q4"}]}},"SharePrice":{"label":"Share Price","description":"Price of a single share of a number of saleable stocks of a company.","units":{"USD/shares":[{"end":"2020-03-31","val":10.12,"accn":"0001213900-21-026760","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020Q1I"},{"end":"2020-11-30","val":10.18,"accn":"0001213900-21-024207","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-03"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-024207","fy":2020,"fp":"FY","form":"10-K/A","filed":"2021-05-03"},{"end":"2020-12-31","val":10.5,"accn":"0001213900-21-026760","fy":2021,"fp":"Q1","form":"10-Q","filed":"2021-05-17","frame":"CY2020Q4I"}]}},"StockholdersEquity":{"label":"Stockholders' Equity Attributable to Parent","description":"Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.
